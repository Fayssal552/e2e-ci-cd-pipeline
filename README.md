# e2e-ci-cd-pipeline
Automated Java Application Deployment on Kubernetes using Maven, SonarQube, Docker, Jenkins, and Argo CD

# Project Description

The project involves building and deploying a Java application using a CI/CD pipeline. The following steps are involved in the process:

1. **Version Control**: The code is stored in a version control system such as Git, and hosted on GitHub. The code is organized into branches such as the `main` or `development` branch.

2. **Continuous Integration**: [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) is used as the CI server to build the application. Whenever there is a new code commit, Jenkins automatically pulls the code from GitHub and builds it using Maven.

3. **Code Quality**: [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) is used to analyze the code and report on code quality issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells. The SonarQube analysis is triggered as part of the Jenkins build pipeline.

4. **Containerization**: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is used to containerize the Java application. The Dockerfile is stored in the Git repository along with the source code. The Dockerfile specifies the environment and dependencies required to run the application.

5. **Container Registry**: The Docker image is pushed to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/), a public or private Docker registry. The Docker image can be versioned and tagged for easy identification.

6. **Continuous Deployment**: [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) is used to automate the deployment of the containerized application to Kubernetes. Whenever a new version of the application image is pushed to the Git repository, Argo CD will automatically deploy it to the Kubernetes cluster.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, please follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the Git repository to your local machine:

2. Install Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker, and Argo CD following the respective official documentation.

3. Set up the CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins to build and deploy the Java application using the provided configurations.

4. Ensure you have access to a Kubernetes cluster where Argo CD can deploy the containerized application.

## Usage

Once the CI/CD pipeline is set up, any new code commits pushed to the `main` or `development` branch on GitHub will trigger the pipeline. Jenkins will build the application, and SonarQube will analyze the code quality. The Docker image will be pushed to DockerHub, and Argo CD will automatically deploy the application to your Kubernetes cluster.
